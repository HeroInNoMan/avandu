Avandu is an emacs mode that connects to a Tiny Tiny RSS instance and
allows you to read the feeds it has gathered locally.

The simplest way to install it is to use package.el:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (package-install-file "/path/to/avandu.el")
#+end_src

For further information I would like to refer you to the avandu info
file.

Once installation is out of the way, it should get a value for
=avandu-tt-rss-api-url= (for example: http://tt-rss.org/demo/api/) and
then run =avandu-overview=.

Once in avandu:overview mode some key bindings will be:

- ~r~:: Mark article at point as read.
- ~u~:: Mark article at point as unread.
- ~o~:: Open article at point in a browser.  Uses =browse-url=.
- ~n~:: Next article.
- ~p~:: Previous article.
